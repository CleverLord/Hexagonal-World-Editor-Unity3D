Requirements:

This is not regular hexagonal world editor. What makes it so special is the awareness of the surroundings and ability to change behaviour with something as simple as a plugin. It was built to handle every aspect of hexagonal maps that a single developer can ever require. During creation I kept in mind the needs of creating the hexagonal versions of different games, starting with Minecraft and ending with Factorio. To have good experience, I managed to use Dictionary<Enum,String> that has to be saved as asset, and thus, the Odin reuirement.
